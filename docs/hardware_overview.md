??? tip "Need more measurements?"
	For more information about the board's dimensions, users can download the [eagle files](../board_files/eagle_files.zip) for the board. These files can be opened in Eagle and additional measurements can be made with the dimensions tool.

## :material-lightning-bolt:&nbsp;Power

Users are provided with [PTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology "Plated Through Holes") to connect their external power supply, the output voltage from the board, and the [`EN`](#power-control "Enable") power control pin for the buck regulator. The AP3429A buck regulator has an input voltage range is **2.7V** to **5.5V**. Each board has a different regulated output voltage (**1.8V** or **3.3V**) and input voltage range. *(These are step-down DC/DC converters and cannot step-up or boost the voltage output.)*

Below, is a general summary of the circuitry on the board:

* **`VIN`** - Power supply input
    * 1.8V Buck Regulator: **<span style="color:red">2.7V</span> to 5.5V**
    * 3.3V Buck Regulator: **<span style="color:green">3.9V</span> to 5.5V**
* **`EN`** - Enables the power output of the board
	* Has an input voltage range up to **5.5V**
	* Must be pulled `HIGH` above **1.5V** to enable the power output. Otherwise, if pulled `LOW` below 0.4V, the device shuts down.
* **`VOUT`** - Regulated 1.8V or 3.3V output *(up to 2A)*
* **`GND`** - The common ground or the 0V reference for the board

!!! info
	For more details, users can reference the [schematic](../board_files/schematic.pdf) and the [datasheets of the individual components](../resources/#hardware-component-documentation) in the power circuitry.

??? tip "Maximum Load Current"
	While the IC is rated up to 2A, we were able to squeeze a little extra juice for a maximum load of ~2.2A. Anything near 2.4A, the board will start to struggle and automatically shut down.
	
	***Disclaimer:** We don't recommend that users expect to be able to load the boards with a maximum 2.2A, as we are not sure how this may affect the lifespan of the board. We just want users to know that they may have an extra margin of safety on their peak load.* 

??? tip "Quiescent Current Draw"
    Users should expect a maximum quiescent current draw of ~365&micro;A from the board. For a lower quiescent current, users can modify the board by removing the pull-up resistor on the [`EN`](#power-control "enable") pin.

		!!! danger
			Modifying a board to remove the pull-up resistor, requires advanced soldering skills. Users should **not** attempt this modification unless it is absolutely, necessary and they are confident in their skills because the board can be permanently damaged.

#### :material-audio-input-stereo-minijack:&nbsp;Barrel Jack

PTH *(slots)* are provided for users to add a [barrel jack connector](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/119) to the top or bottom of the board. This provides users with an alternative method to connect a power supply to their board.

!!! info "Barrel Jack Size"
	Our recommended [barrel jack connector](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/119) is a 5.5mm barrel jack.

### :material-power:&nbsp;Power Control

There is an enable pin (`EN`) to control the output voltage *(i.e. on/off)*, with a typical threshold voltage of **1.5V** and a range up to **5.5V**

* Users should pull the `EN` pin high *(above 1.5V)* to enable the switching power output and pull the pin low *(below 0.4V)* to disable it.
	* Users can connect the `EN` pin to `VIN` to override the [UVLO]("Undervoltage Lockout") threshold.

!!! tip "Default Configuration"
	On our boards, the `EN` pin is pulled `HIGH` and the power output from the board is enabled by default.

!!! info
	For more details, please refer to the [AP3429A datasheet](../component_documentation/AP3429A.pdf) and [application note](../component_documentation/AN_AP3428.pdf).


??? tip "Power Efficiency"
	Users should expect a power efficiency close to the chart presented in the [datasheet](../component_documentation/AP3429A.pdf) *(i.e. ~80% with smaller loads and up to +90% with larger loads)*. It should be noted that the efficiency varies with the load current and cooling.

	</figure>


??? info "Circuit Protection"
	The AP3429A features the following circuit protections:

	=== "Undervoltage Lockout"
		We have found the undervoltage lockout to trigger ~2.7V for the 1.8V breakout and ~3.9V for the 3.3V breakout board.
	
	=== "Over Current Protection"
		
		* If the peak current is higher than the current limit threshold, it will enter cycle-by-cycle current limit mode.
		* If short is detected, when the feedback voltage (V~FB~) drops under 0.3V, the AP3429 will turn off power output until the `VIN` or `EN` is cycled again to release it.
			* Once V~FB~ rises over 0.3V, the AP3429A automatically recovers to normal operation.
	
	=== "Over Voltage Protection"
		* **Output:** When `VOUT` exceeds 120% of the regulation level, the output power will be disabled until `VIN` or `EN` is cycled.
		* **Input:** When the input voltage is near 6.25V, the IC will shut down until the input voltage drops back down below 6V.


### Output Voltage Configuration

The output voltage from the AP3429A, is determined by the voltage divider on the feedback loop, as discussed in the [application note](../component_documentation/AN_AP3428.pdf).

??? tip "Application Note"
	While the [application note](../component_documentation/AN_AP3428.pdf) only lists the AP3428 buck converter, Diodes Incorporated has assured us that it is still applicable to the AP3429A.


$$
V_{OUT} =  0.6 * \frac{ (R_1 + R_2) }{ R_2 }
$$

Where, R~1~ and R~2~ are the resistors in the feedback loop:

## :material-selection-multiple-marker:&nbsp;Output Voltage Indicator

## :hotsprings:&nbsp;Heat Sink Pad

A 0.5" x 0.6" platted copper pad is provided on the back of the boards, where users can add a heat sink to dissipate excess heat generated by the AP3429A. The pad can accommodate the [copper heatsink](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18704) in our catalog.

??? info "Thermal Shutdown Temperature"
	The AP329A has a 160&deg;C (320&deg;F) thermal shutdown temperature. The AP3429A will restart automatically when the junction temperature decreases to +130¬∞C.
